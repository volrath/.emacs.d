# .emacs.d

My own flavored version of [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude)'s
configuration, mixed with a bunch of ideas and snippets taken from [magnars'
.emacs.d](https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d).

This is still very alpha, and I don't know if that will change in the future. I
strongly recommend taking a look at:
