# .emacs.d (Charlotte)

## To the history books

I created this version of my Emacs configuration in 2017. It was the second time
I 'declared bankruptcy' and started the adventure of setting up my Emacs from
scratch (though not reaaally from scratch, I copied a lot from other people!).

Back then, I had just move to a nice little flat in Charlottenburg,
Berlin. First place I rented on my own. It was really the beginning of a new
life.

So this version of my Emacs setup is called *Charlotte*, in memory of that time
I spent living near its castle.

My own flavored version of [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude)'s
configuration, mixed with a bunch of ideas and snippets taken from [magnars'
.emacs.d](https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d).

This is still very alpha, and I don't know if that will change in the future. I
strongly recommend taking a look at:
