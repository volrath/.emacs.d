* .emacs.d

I do not recommend you use this config yourself, but there might be some
things here and there that are useful to copy :).

** If you still want to try it out

#+begin_src bash
$> git clone https://github.com/volrath/.emacs.d /tmp/.emacs.d

# Then either...
$> HOME=/tmp emacs
# Or...
$> emacs -Q -l /tmp/.emacs.d/init.el
#+end_src

Both options above have their own quirks, but will allow you to quickly try most
of this config out.
