* .emacs.d

I do not recommend you use this config yourself, but there might be some
things here and there that are useful to copy :).

** If you still want to try it out

#+begin_src bash
$> git clone https://github.com/volrath/.emacs.d /tmp/.emacs.d

# Then either...
$> HOME=/tmp emacs
# Or...
$> emacs -Q -l /tmp/.emacs.d/init.el
#+end_src

Both options above have their own quirks, but will allow you to quickly try most
of this config out.

** External dependencies

Some keybindings and other functionality depend on these external libraries
being installed:

- Font: [[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode][Fira Code]]
- [[https://clojure-lsp.io/][clojure-lsp]]
- [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]] and [[https://github.com/tadfisher/pass-otp][pass-otp]]
- [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]]
- docker, git, and other stuff you probably have already installed.
