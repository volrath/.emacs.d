* .emacs.d

I do not recommend you use this config yourself, but there might be some
things here and there that are useful to copy :).

** If you still want to try it out

#+begin_src bash
  $> git clone https://github.com/volrath/.emacs.d /tmp/.emacs.d
  $> emacs --init-directory /tmp/.emacs.d  # If you're on Emacs 29.1+

  # If you're on an older version of Emacs, then try either...
  $> HOME=/tmp emacs
  # Or...
  $> emacs -Q -l /tmp/.emacs.d/init.el
#+end_src

** External dependencies

Some keybindings and other functionality depend on these external libraries
being installed:

- Fonts: [[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode][Fira Code]] & [[https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka][Iosevka Aile]]
- Icons: From within Emacs run ~M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts~
- Mail: [[https://notmuchmail.org/][notmuch]] (and likely something like [[http://www.offlineimap.org/][offlineimap]] too)
- [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]] and [[https://github.com/tadfisher/pass-otp][pass-otp]]
- [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]]
- [[http://aspell.net/][aspell]]
- LSP Servers as needed
- docker, git, and other stuff you probably have already installed.
- [optional] [[https://www.leonerd.org.uk/code/libvterm/][libvterm]] (also Emacs needs to be compiled with modules)
- [optional] [[https://github.com/darold/pgFormatter][pgFormatter]] for formatting SQL through [[https://github.com/purcell/sqlformat][sqlformat]].
